# Follow Language Language

## Working On

TODO List

- add comment block into semantic tokens;
- add file structure information for vscode;
- proof action(axiom or theorem) need more hint, inline hint and nextline hint in text space;
- auto complete; this should be the most powerful part of follow. NO MORE LANGUAGE RULES, BUT MORE INTELLIGENT AUTO COMPLETION;
- create full of set.fol from set.mm;
- code formatter;

I want to achieve this:

- A website or app for people to use this language:
- problem set like leetcode, learn by doing;
- formal strict proof or intuative visualized proof, learn by teaching;
- communatiion between people, learn by talking;
- BEST RESULT: create while learning;
- ...

## New State Description

- `[Y]`: Used and can be reused assumption;
- `[N]`: Unused and can be reused assumption;
- `[*]`: Should be proved assumption;
